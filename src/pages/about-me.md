I’m a London based interaction designer. I help organisations design at scale and deliver usable, accessible, inclusive services. 

I’m currently the Head of Interaction Design at the Government Digital Service in the UK, where I lead the team behind the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

I have a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence and Linguistics from the University of Edinburgh.

## Government Digital Service

I joined GDS in 2012, when I was part of the team that designed GOV.UK. It won the 2013 [design of the year](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22164715) awards and a [D&AD black pencil](https://www.dandad.org/awards/professional/2013/writing-for-design/20081/govuk/).

In my first few years at GDS I led on the design of exemplar services for different government departments, including MoJ, DWP, HMRC and Defra.

My focus then shifted to developing the design capability of departments, through community building and by delivering design training, tools and resources.

Most recently I built and now lead the team behind the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), a collection of tools, guidance and code for making usable, accessible government services.

## Transport for London

Before joining GDS, I led the digital design team at Transport for London.
